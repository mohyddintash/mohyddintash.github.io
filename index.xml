      <description>Pathfinder is a fully automated visual aid artificial assistant for the visually impaired and navigation system running in parallel via a sensor-fitted belt, connected to a cloud based mobile application.
This project started out while my friends and I were still at the university. It was one of our first experiences in the ecosystem of startups and entrepreneurship.
How it works: The device consists of two main parts:
 The belt which contains the arduino and the LAIDAR sensor for detecting slopes and edges, etc.</description>
