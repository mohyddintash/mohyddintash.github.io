      <description>Steam Doctor is a disinfection chamber designed to provide steam powered sterialization for people in public places. It also has audio/visual output features.
In this project I was responsible for design and development of the firmware that operates the system.
Requirements:  The system is required to have the following properties:
 Detect human presence. Output audio feedback through speakers to notify the user about status and/or call to action. Take user&amp;rsquo;s temperature.</description>

      <description>Pathfinder is a fully automated visual aid artificial assistant for the visually impaired and navigation system running in parallel via a sensor-fitted belt, connected to a cloud based mobile application.
This project started out while my friends and I were still at the university. It was one of our first experiences in the ecosystem of startups and entrepreneurship.
How it works: The device consists of two main parts:
 The belt which contains the arduino and the LAIDAR sensor for detecting slopes and edges, etc.</description>
